# Rigid Backed Porous Absorber

A porous absorber layer of thickness ***t<sub>a</sub>*** is mounted over a rigid backing.

Two absorption curves are calculated:

* The porous absorber layer is mounted directly to the rigid backing, or
* The porous absorber is mounted above an air gap of depth ***d***
