# Microperforated Panel

A microperforated absorber does not require a porous absorber layer because energy losses are achieved using the viscous boundary layer within the perforations.  In order for this device type to be effective, the perforation diameter must be sub-millimetre.

The advantage of this device type is that it can be constructed from a transparent material such as perspex or glass.

A microperforated panel of thickness ***t<sub>p</sub>*** with circular holes of radius ***a*** at a spacing ***D*** is mounted above a cavity whose total depth is ***d***.

Since the holes and panel thickness of the microperforated panel are so small, if you switch on the "Show diagram" checkbox, the hole dimensions and the spacing between the holes will be magnified by a factor of 20.  This is simply for the purpose of visibility
